During Protégé Undergraduate Research Program, I worked in Dr. Rashmi Jha’s MIND lab on a project “Electrical Simulation of Neural Signals”. The program lasted four months, during which I researched on this topic as a full-time research student. For most of my time of research, I read books and literature, took notes, conducted experiment in the lab, collected data, analyzed the data and crafted my own design.

This experience had teached me a lot of academic knowledge that I am about to learn in the incoming years (MOSFETs, amplifiers, microcontrollers, SPICE simulations, etc.), as well as some hands-on skills such as using different measuring instruments and soldering. In addition, this was my first time being an actual researcher in a lab so I have built a concept what it feels like to be in academia. My lab colleague were kind and patient to explain things I did not know. Despite their eagerness to accomplish their goal, one must finish this job on his/her own. This also involves the awareness of intellectual properties. I also learned effective ways to deliver information to different kinds of audience, for example, writing documentation and make presentation in a symposium. On the other hand, by studying on the concept of neuromorphic computing and trying to understand what other lab members have been doing, I have a general idea of how current technology has advanced and how I can participate into this.

I would like to present my poster as a sample work of this experience. This summarizes in detail what I learned, what I wanted to do and what I accomplished. It is self-explanatory, informative and targeted to general public.

Lastly I hope this experience will help me clarify my academic interests and pave my way in the future. I might ask Dr. Jha to include me in her lab again in the incoming semesters.
