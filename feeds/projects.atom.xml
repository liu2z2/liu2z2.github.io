&lt;p&gt;This article talks about the technical aspects and takeaway from two inter-connecting projects from Intro to Computer Architecture and Organization Class.
The detail about the class is explained in my &lt;a href="../Discussion/spring-2021.md"&gt;Spring 2021 Remark&lt;/a&gt;.
More info about the projects is available at my &lt;a href="https://github.com/liu2z2/class-files/tree/main/spring2021-comp-org"&gt;class-files repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="non-pipelined-control-unit"&gt;Non-Pipelined Control Unit&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#non-pipelined-control-unit" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single-bus processing unit was designed capable of executing a set of instructions specified as in Fig. 1.
The design was implemented at the gate level. Some restrictions of the assignment include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design should be restricted to single-bus paradigm. No point-to-point connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read-only memory (ROM) may be used to contain up to 8 constants. Its design can be specified descriptively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main memory (MM) design can be specified descriptively and performs asynchronously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gate level design must only use MUX, DEMUX, encoder, decoder, flip-flop and gates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed count-down timer design can be specified descriptively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/instr-table.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 1: Instruction set &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4 id="solution-brief"&gt;Solution Brief&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#solution-brief" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presented our design in a modular structure, which of which is used extensively by the CPU to meet the design requirements and achieve optimization.
An abstract overview of the CPU is shown in Fig. 2.
Data used in the instructions is pushed to a 16-bit bus as the only conveyance before being delivered to the intended locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/data-path.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 2: Abstract view of the data path &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started the Control Unit design by firstly defining the control signals needed in each instructions, during which we also discussed necessary changes and possible optimizations in the data path.
The common fetch-decode-execute sequence was adopted as a general guideline.
Afterwards, the control signals are collapsed into groups such that states can be determined, as well as the state transition.
With the aforementioned state information narrowed down, the gate-level circuit was implemented as a Moore machine whose input is Opcode and various control flags from other components on the data bus, and whose output is to enable tri-state buffers on data paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/state-trans.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 3: State transition diagram &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/control-unit.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 4: Control unit block component view &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detail on other components is explained in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/liu2z2/class-files/tree/main/fall2021-comp-org/project-3-report.pdf"&gt;project report&lt;/a&gt;. Related optimizations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use Y and Z as pre- and post- buffer for the ALU operations, respectively, by statically writing in common register values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insead of sending six different control signals to dictate ALU functions for Opcode 0-5, whose operands are in similar format, the control unit commences a master signal which lets the ALU requests the Opcode directly to decide on the specific logical/arithmetic operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ALU utilizes a carry lookahead adder-subtractor circuit in order to add or subtract two 16-bit values and output a single 16-bit value.
  The carry lookahead generator, while it utilizes more gates than the
  ripple-carry adder design, results in a significant decrease in propagation delay and performance time through the operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/data-path-block.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig 5: Data path block diagram &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4 id="takeaway"&gt;Takeaway&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#takeaway" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, we went through the design and part of the implementation phase of a digital/register level project.
We broke down the specification, explored possible solution, discussed possible optimization and eventually documented our solution within the time constraints.
As a class assignment, we have scored the highest grade with a few points taken off due to formatting inconsistency.
The project also gave us a chance to reflect on our understanding of the material, and luckily we were given enough time to clarify some questions over the discussion of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pipelined-control-unit"&gt;Pipelined Control Unit&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#pipelined-control-unit" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, we were assigned to design a CPU with almost the same functionality, except the operation can be pipelined, and that the gate-level implementation is not required.
Other limitations include I/O constraints, register space capacity, etc, are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No hard restriction on data path, but all paths should be used reasonably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main memory (MM) has separate instruction and data ports that can be used simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register file (GPR) has 3 read ports and 2 write ports and all can be accessed simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pipeline should include at least three stages, corresponding to the fetch/decode/execute cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read-only memory (ROM) may be used to contain up to 8 constants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="solution-brief_1"&gt;Solution Brief&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#solution-brief_1" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the functionality of this machine has many parts that overlap with the previous project, the detailed design and implementation were only briefly covered, whereas the pipeline is mainly discussed in the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pipeline design consists of four unique stages: F1, F2, D1 and E1, matching the fetch/decode/execute cycle instruction cycle (Figure 6).
Although some states share hardware resources, each has its own portion of the data path and dedicated portion of the control unit.
By this design, each state only uses 1 clock cycle to finish, resulting in an ideal instruction completion time of 4 clock cycles - with a possible 4 instructions in the pipeline.
Though it was hard to implement such system, this was a firm decision we made at the very beginning and we were determined to resolve the hazards from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/pipeline-timing.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 6: Four stage pipeline &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we decipher the hazards individually, we designed a hardware queue system that dispatches instruction register (IR) and PC data to each stages, ensuring the correct flow of the pipeline.
The implementation of the queuing on IR and PC is 16 stacks of 4-bit and 3-bit shift registers, respectively, shown in Fig. 7.
The memory organization of them can be seen in Fig. 8, where each row is a shift register that can be controlled to shift, keep, or clear on each element, whereas a column represents a full IR/PC data.
Additionally, by having a digitally controlled buffer from the clock to the RESET of the flip-flops, the register can also be cleared synchronously with the rest of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/q-mem-org.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 7: Memory organization of the queues &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/shift-reg.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 8: Partial demonstration of shift register control &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to reflect this queue transition, the control unit commences command for various event during runtime.
The control unit on the top level is demonstrated in Fig. 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/pipeline-control-unit.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 9: Control unit top level design &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stage Controller enables and disables the stages of the pipeline. The Queue Controller keeps the queue in synchronization with the stage behavior by moving forward the shift registers.
At this level, the machine can be seen repeating on a normal state so long as there are no hazards or exceptions.
In the event when they appear, the control unit enters states where it resolves the issue, then go back to looping state.
These states are listed in Fig. 10, along with the GO state when the machine operates normally.
The table also specifies whether to enable specific stages and the control over the queue, which will be justified in sections on hazards and exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/pipeline-states.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 10: States &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural hazards, data hazards and control hazards are addressed separately.
The main idea in our solution is stalling, or descriptively, prioritize execution (E1), and keep other stages from moving, until the hazard is unflagged.
The analysis of each can be found in the project report.
A summary is we exhaust all possible hazards, determined the true conditions, such that the implementation could be as simple as combinatorial gates.
As for control hazards, we were well aware that a dynamic branch predictor is more popular and normally more efficient.
However, since the data path design is determined before considering the control hazards, a limitation is placed to only update PC at execution (E1), making it ineffective even if the predictor predicts “taken”.
Thus, it was decided to use a branch predictor that statically predicts “not taken”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-control-unit/hazard-timing.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Fig. 11: Hazard delay example &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4 id="takeaway_1"&gt;Takeaway&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#takeaway_1" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the previous assignment, though not requiring a gate-level implementation, this project was more analytically challenging for us as it requires deeper and applicable understanding of pipeline design.
Plus, we also decided on a even more ambitious goal of only allows one step in each stage.
Luckily, with the collective effort of trials and errors, we were able to make sense of everything and deliver the project in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the project, though not required as an assignment, we hope with capable hardware such as FPGA, we could actually implement both machines to reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category><category term="project"></category><category term="hardware"></category><category term="class"></category></entry><entry><title>Developing a Gas Price Tracking and Prediction Application</title><link href="https://liu2z2.github.io/articles/20200429-developing-a-gas-price-tracking-and-prediction-application" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Liu</name></author><id>tag:liu2z2.github.io,2020-04-29:/articles/20200429-developing-a-gas-price-tracking-and-prediction-application</id><summary type="html">

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is about developing a web application based on data that is related to automobile gas prices. The desired feature of the application is that it collects gas prices at different places every day (specific to stations), recommends the user the cheapest station in the area, reminds the user of an increasing/decreasing trend of the price, and generates a report of gas prices that is helpful to economic analysis. It falls under creativity competency because by the time the project was proposed, there has not been similar tools for this specific application, so it could be hard to decide on how to implement this idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience will let me know the process of developing an application skill-wise, during which I would utilize my programming, math and engineering skills to achieve the end goal of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the app will help people save money on their commuting travel. On the other hand, the data I collected would be a useful resource to understand oil-related economy, realize potential problems and possibly propose a solution applicable to the original idea of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="procedure"&gt;Procedure&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#procedure" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I divided the project into a few phases. 1) Setting up the environment and base code; 2) building the database by updating on daily basis; 3) developing a method for data statistics; and 4) developing the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase took longer than expected because I needed to pick up SQL database, which I did not have too much experience working with before. In addition, I also had to make sure everything is set up well so that the data collected later is comprehensive but easy to manage. Afterwards, at the end of October 2019, the code was put in a computer programmed to run once per day (phase two).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the data collecting process, several issues occurred due to hardware and software, making it inconsistent at a few time stamps, but luckily, they got fixed quickly so the overall data trend was not interrupted. After a few months, the database was found large enough for statistical analysis, so the third phase started after 2019’s Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of this part was also time consuming, as I was trying different statistical tools while also learning database merging methods in order for the source files to look professionally organized. Unfortunately, right after I finished my research and decided a way to implement (at the end of February 2020), COVID-19 hit the country hard. During the time I struggled to adapt to working-from-home environment, I decided to close the project as it is considering two reasons. Firstly, I wanted to prioritize finishing my classes and research until the end of the semester; and secondly, the gas market may have been affected by the pandemic, which is an significantly influential variable that may complicate the case study. Therefore, at the end of the Spring semester 2020, I briefly implemented data visualization by plotting the data per city, and concluded the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical aspect of the project will be explained in the &lt;a href="https://liu2z2.github.io/tags#project-ref"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; category while this reflection mainly focused on the overall execution and the learning experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of the visualized data as of the closing phase of the project are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. Plotted in different colors, the mean prices of three gas grades are connected together with respect to time, where there are vertical grey bars whose upper and lower bounds illustrate the max and min price number. Then the three curves are put together in the same plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/discuss-gastrack/Lexington.webp" width="30%"/&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/discuss-gastrack/Cincinnati.webp" width="30%"/&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/discuss-gastrack/Columbus.webp" width="30%"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing and contrasting the plots result in a few interesting findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluctuations of the prices in three gas grades share similar patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices in neighbored areas may increase/decrease at similar time, but the amount may vary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding a specific gas grade in one area, lowest price point changes in a similar manner as the mean price, but the max price point is quite stationary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the end goal of the project was not achieved before closing, the method of web crawling and data mining was proven viable for the intended application, and I believe it can lead to a promising direction if more effort and time are given. Better project management could have been used to improve the productivity, but there are still proud parts in the execution, such as breaking the process down into several phases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, if the project is ever to be continued, there are a few recommendations for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few interruptions in the data collecting phase for various reasons. For example, the program crashed because of unexpected errors. Incidents like this can be avoided by considering more edge cases when writing the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data was obtained by web scraping gasbuddy.com, which is a website where anyone can upload data. This source can be inaccurate and unreliable sometimes. Better sources can be used to improve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must have been more statistical tools that can be used for analysis. More exhaustive research on them could offer more information about the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make prediction, apart from a larger amount of dataset and a well-modeled algorithm, a good understanding of economics can be important. Generalizing patterns as discussed in the results section is important, but an educated guess may also come from an existing the economic model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a learning experience, this project enhances my software programming skills, which I don’t usually learn from my EE curriculum. This was also my first time using SQL database, which I found is a useful tool with a steep learning curve. Finally, as of the closing phase, I came to realize that I did not know enough statistical and economical tools to understand the data comprehensively, and therefore I became interested and motivated to learn them along my study.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category><category term="UHP"></category></entry><entry><title>A Chiptune Music System with OPL2 and Reality Adlib Tracker</title><link href="https://liu2z2.github.io/articles/20191202-a-chiptune-music-system-with-opl2-and-reality-adlib-tracker" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Liu</name></author><id>tag:liu2z2.github.io,2019-12-02:/articles/20191202-a-chiptune-music-system-with-opl2-and-reality-adlib-tracker</id><summary type="html">

&lt;p&gt;The source of the project can be found at my GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/liu2z2/opl2-chiptune"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to build a system with the old-school electronic components that plays Chiptune music, as well as composing the music with compatible software. This is a project for the class Japanese Music Online during Fall 2019 semester.  Dr. Kazuaki Shiota was really nice to let me do this for the final project of the class. The project helped me understand the theory behind Chiptune Music from a musical and engineering standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-chiptune-music-works"&gt;How Chiptune Music Works&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-chiptune-music-works" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="beeper-speakers"&gt;Beeper Speakers&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#beeper-speakers" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In embedded systems, I have experimented generating music made by square-waves with a piezoelectric speaker. The tone of the music is adjusted by the frequency of the square waves, as a method called “Frequency Modulation (FM)”. Such “beeper speaker” system is how early home computers generate sounds, except the CPU also handles other processes as a normal PC does (Figure 1). Different tones can be played by varying the frequency of the square waves, however, it requires all of the CPU’s run-time to implement advanced sound of music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="fm-synthesizer"&gt;FM Synthesizer&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#fm-synthesizer" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this issue, computers in the early 1980’s use dedicated sound chip (Figure 2), which is the early form of the sound cards in today’s computers. Except for taking the processing load away from the CPU, this method also creates possibility to develop more advanced sound generation and even synthesis. Three examples can be examined as examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-chiptune/fm-synth.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Figure 1 (Left) - Non-Dedicated Sound Chip; Figure 2 (Right) - Dedicated Sound Chip &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4 id="nintendo-entertainment-system-nes"&gt;Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nintendo-entertainment-system-nes" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound chip in NES is able to generate five channels, each of which features different types of waveforms (Figure 3). Channel #1 and #2 gives square waves, Channel #3 gives triangle waves, Channel #4 gives noise and Channel #5 is PCM sample, which modulate pre-recorded sound waves. Though the tone can be different, this method makes the music sounds like being played by the same set of instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-chiptune/NES.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Figure 3 - NES Sound Chip &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4 id="commodore-64"&gt;Commodore 64&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#commodore-64" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodore uses a different approach to synthesize music. The chip has 3 channels, each of which can produce waveforms among square, triangle and sawtooth wave (Figure 4) . Initially, engineers assign used to assign one waveform to a channel and write the tone associated with the wave. This seems inferior to the NES system as it only has 3 channels, despite that the combination of the waveforms can be variable. However, later engineers realized that waveform can be reassigned to channels on the fly, which has opened a great amount of variability to the music. This methods have been proved successful and extended to the next generation of sound card in PC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an improved version of the Commodor 64 sound chip, the Adlib Sound Card is used in the later IBM PC. The Card is replaced with Sound Blaster later due to the market loss,  but the key component - YM3812 FM Operator chip is used in both boards. This chip is considered the foundation of computer music on IBM PC for a decade, and can even found in some Yamaha electronic piano keyboards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YM3812&lt;/strong&gt; is an Frequency Modulation Operator Type-L2 (OPL2) integrated chip that can simultaneously generate 9 channels of different types of waveforms. Since this chip was widely used in early computer systems, there are still supporting documents, software, and projects related to it, so it has been determined as the core of this project as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hardware-setup"&gt;Hardware Setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 is the hardware setup of the system in block diagram. The music file stored in the SD card is read by the microcontroller (μC). The OPL2 chip uses 4-line bus for control signal and 8-line bus for data transfer. To reduce the load on the microcontroller, the data is sent in serial first to a shift register, and then transmitted to the OPL2 chip after the conversion. The digital output of the FM operation is thereafter transferred to a DAC, whose analog output is amplified to become the eventual sound that can be played by a speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-chiptune/block.png"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Figure 5 - Block Diagram &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed schematic of the system is in Figure 9. It is made in KiCAD, a free CAD software for PCB design. In order to reduce the cross-talk and noise of the system, it was decided to make the system into a PCB. After a few hours’ layout design, the final version of the board (Figure 10) is submitted to OSH Park Proto-PCB Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KiCAD files are available in the GitHub repository attached at the begining of the post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="software"&gt;Software&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#software" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software portion of the project consists of the controlling program on the microcontroller and the music composing software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the microcontroller is determined to be Arduino Uno as it’s the most available option, the controlling program is written in C++ in Arduino IDE. In addition to an external OPL2 library that handles the communication protocol, libraries such as SD and SPI are included too for the SD module board. The Arduino code is available in the GitHub repository attached at the end of the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality Adlib Tacker II (Figure 11) is the software for me to compose the music. It is a music tracker with an old-school GUI but an extensive documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id="result-demonstration"&gt;Result Demonstration&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#result-demonstration" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the PCB design is manufactured, an alpha prototype is made on a breadboard, in order to test the functionality of the design. The video below demonstrates the alpha system playing a sample test music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFG_2tbkUiI" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the design is functional, the next phase was a hardware and software upgrade. Hardware-wise, the PCB was sent to the manufacturer and assembled later. Software-wise, a specific piece of music was chosen to be recreated with the Tracker by myself. The video below is the final version of the system, playing Megalovania from the game Undertale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="summary-and-recommendation"&gt;Summary and Recommendation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#summary-and-recommendation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this multi-disciplinary project was not only successful but also meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a music standpoint, I learned how early electronic/computer music works and experienced the same method of composing it as the early 1900s game designed did. I am amazed too by the ingenuity of them making a variety of music with such limited system. Luckily, chiptune (or 8-bit) music remains as a featured style of music nowadays, which, to some extent, pays a tribute to those who used to work on electronic music composition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an electrical engineering standpoint, this is a thorough embedded system engineering project starting from an idea, to research, design, assembly, testing and eventually realization. A lot of effort was used in designing the circuit, which is one of reasons of deciding to make a PCB. I also gained experience in audio engineering, such as signal amplification and reducing noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some recommendations are listed for future improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of using Arduino Uno board, the system can be simpler by integrating Teensy board into the PCB. Thus, the system will become an actual sound card. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OPL2 library was used, but not fully understood yet. Reading through the code may help understanding the theories of operation even more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of loading the sound file in the SD card is time-consuming. It can be improved by developing a direct interface with PC and the system. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source of the project can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/liu2z2/nullclineplot"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a whole project, but actually part of the final project on a class called Math Modelling. For the project, my friend, Wayne Stegner (Computer Engineering Undergraduate at UC), and I were supposed to model an age-based predation and analyze the behavior of the model. This article will not focus on how we approached the model mathematically, but rather how we used Python to plot the model for the steady state analysis to avoid solving for multi-variable differential equations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model was reduced to two equations in (Eq 1), where u and v are independent variables. &lt;strong&gt;Steady state&lt;/strong&gt; is where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{du}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{dv}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt; are both 0. However, it can be difficult to solve by setting both equations to 0, so we can use nullclines of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{du}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{dv}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt; instead. &lt;strong&gt;Nullcline&lt;/strong&gt; of a variable is the plot where the derivative this variable over time is 0. Therefore, the intercept of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; represents steady state. Moreover, a steady state can also be &lt;strong&gt;stable&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;unstable&lt;/strong&gt;. This is done by &lt;strong&gt;linear stability analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. In this specific model, it was found that the steady state is stable if the equation in Eq. 2 is positive; otherwise unstable. Thus, the discussion over steady state is around two questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does steady state exist in the given domain? How many of them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the steady state stable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python script that plots the model is supposed to give a direct answer to these two questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{d}{d\tau} v = B u - v - D v (u+v) - P v \\
\frac{d}{d\tau} u = v - u (u+v) - Q u
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: right"&gt; Differential Equations of the Model (Eq 1) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
D = (- 1 - Du - 2Dv - P)(-2u - v - Q) - (1 - u)(B - D v)
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: right"&gt; Stability Criterion (Eq 2) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#methodology" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two differential equations in Eq. 1 are both functions of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt;, so by plotting the u-nullcline and v-nullcline on a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt;-vs-&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; coordinate plane, steady state is where the two nullclines intercept. If they ever intercept, steady state exist, and how many intercepts dictates the number of steady states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt; variable in Eq. 2 is also a function of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt;, but now the criterion is its sign, or an inequality between 0. On one hand, plugging in a steady state expression that is already complicated is hard, on the other hand, graphically, such inequality separates the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u-v\)&lt;/span&gt; plane into two areas, positive &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt; and negative &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore, a contour map of this &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt; function can be superimposed onto the two nullcline plot. If their intercept is located in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D&amp;gt;0\)&lt;/span&gt; region, the steady state is stable; otherwise unstable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="result"&gt;Result&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#result" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plotting was successful. We were able to test the steady states by setting different external parameters (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(B\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Q\)&lt;/span&gt;) and draw conclusions out of the testings without math-heavy calculations. Some example results are shown figures below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-i-learned-from-this"&gt;What I learned from this&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#what-i-learned-from-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math sometimes can be hard and time-consuming for engineers. Luckily, with adequate programming skills, computer plotting can be helpful, making math analysis experimental. Such implementation, however, requires a clear vision on the math itself as well as an appropriate way to visualize the data. For our math modelling project, we were able to identify the two questions the analysis is based upon, and create a good method to answer both in one plot, making the program useful to the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a project I started personally since March 2019 when I worked as a peer tutor at UC Tutoring Center (previously called Learning Commons). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Peer Tutoring works at UC is that students schedule appointments with me, and I get email notification when they do so. TutorTrac is a system where students schedule appointments, and I see my appointments beforehand. An example of how the system looks is shown in Figure 1. However, though being a stable system maintained since 2011, TutorTrac has some inconvenient features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is hard for me to navigate when I use my phone to look at my schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For every event, it shows Last name first, but we usually refer to students’ first name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only shows the class code of the assisting course instead of full name, making me hard to identify the class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This encourages me to develop my own method of seeing the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-tutorcal/tutortrac.webp"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Figure 1 - TutorTrac System &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="design"&gt;Design&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reads the email notification of incoming tutoring appointments, scrapes the necessary information, and pushes it to my Google calendar in a better format. Thus I can see my schedule directly from the calendar widget of my phone (Android). Ideally it should scan the email notifications every 10-30 minutes and automatically generate events without being monitored. Additional good-to-have feature is that it will also store the appointment info at local, and try to match everyday’s schedule reminder sent from TutorTrac. Later it was found this part was hard to implement given the time, so it was deserted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="design-diagram"&gt;Design diagram&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#design-diagram" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-tutorcal/design.webp"/&gt;

&lt;h4 id="reading-uc-email-notifications"&gt;Reading UC Email Notifications&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#reading-uc-email-notifications" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notification received from TutorTrac follows a specific format (Figure 3). Therefore it is viable to hard-code the format into the program, making the scraping info method easier. Additionally, considering UC email is my most important mail address, as well as the fact that getting around UC server is hard and possibly not allowed, I created a rule at my UC mailbox to automatically forward any emails from TutorTrac to a gmail account I created for this project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-tutorcal/email.webp"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;small&gt; Figure 3 - TutorTrac Email Notif &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4 id="main-program"&gt;Main Program&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#main-program" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program is made up of three python scripts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;email_read.py&lt;/code&gt;: contains functions that reads email from Gmail account and scrape appointment info. Email interface is through imaplib module. Additionally, there is a csv look-up table, where the program can find the matching full name of the class from the course code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;google_cal.py&lt;/code&gt;: contains functions that pushes the appointment info to my Google calendar. This script is inspired by an article on Google site &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python"&gt;Google Calendar API Python Quickstart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;controller.py&lt;/code&gt;: uses the two modules and sets up the logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="hardware-implementation"&gt;Hardware Implementation&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-implementation" title="Permanent link"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project does not requires too much in hardware except for the ability to run Python scripts and Internet accessibility. Therefore a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (Figure 4) was used to implement the design. VNC Viewer is used to remote control the machine wirelessly from other computers. Raspbian with Kernel verion 4.14 was installed on the board, where it was found that there is a Scheduling tool (Figure 5) that lets a command run every period of time. This can also be done by hard-coding in CRON, which is the core of scheduling tool (i.e. scheduling is a GUI of CRON). Detail info about using CRON or scheduling tool see /CRONtest/note.txt on GitHub repo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/project-tutorcal/rpi.webp"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure the program runs completely without errors stopping the process, I changed the script so that the error message will show in log file while the erroneous part is passed. Using &lt;code&gt;logging&lt;/code&gt; module, the code also logs important stages in the operations (Figure 6). I also coded parts where the Internet is used to push/pull data to allow 99 retries, reducing the odds of getting bad connections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was successful. It helped me manage my tutoring schedule over the last month of the semester. I was able to see who scheduled what class at my phone easily. Figure 8 is a side-by-side comparison between TutorTrac and how it turns out in my Google calendar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Access emails in Python with imaplib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Google calendar events with Google API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use logging to maintain a constantly running program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a hardware environment (Raspberry Pi) and method to support a mini-server&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing events can be easy, but retrieving them from my calendar may be hard. For future implementation, it will be good to have an additional module to retrieve the events, check with the local record, thus making sure the schedule is correct. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category><category term="project"></category></entry></feed>
